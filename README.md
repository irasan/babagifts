## Features
### Existing Features
* The navbar contains a logo(name) on top left hand corner to redirect to the landing page. Different site sections (Home, Products, Subscriptions, About and Contact) are placed in the center. In the right corner three icons are displayed: profile, search and shopping bag. Profile icon has a dropdown submenu which 
changes depending on user being logged in or not. If the user is not logged the account submenu will show Register and Login links. If the user is logged in, he'll see Profile and Logout links. If a superuser is logged in, account submenu will show 3 links: Product Management,Profile, and Logout. Search input field will appear when clicking on search icon. It allows to search products and subscriptions. Shopping bag dispays quantity of the items currently put there.  
* The footer shows links to the following pages: Home, F.A.Q., Register, Login, Profile, and social media icons. 
* User authentication: users can register their profiles, log in and log out. 
* On the profile page users can see their default info if any and change it. Subscriptions and past orders will also be displayed. There's also a button to user's wishlist. 
* Any user can browse different products and subscriptions.
* Logged in users can save products to wishlist and see if those products have already been saved (red heart icon will indicate this)
* Any user can buy different products, while subscriptions are only available to registered users.
* Any user (logged in or not) can checkout securely.
* Any user can see confirmations / error messages when completing actions on the website.

## Information Architecture
### Database Choice
The site is linked with the SQlite3 database in development and PostgreSQL in production to allow users to easily obtain information needed. Static files are hosted on AWS.

### Collections Data Structure
This website relies on 2 different collections - Products and Subscriptions. 


## Testing
### Testing Using Validators
Upon completion of the writing process, developer used [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/),
[W3C MarkUp Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), and [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) to check the validity of the code. 
![CSS validation](https://github.com/irasan/read-to-me/blob/master/assets/readme-images/css-validated.png)

![PEP8 validation](https://github.com/irasan/read-to-me/blob/master/assets/readme-images/pep8.png)

### Manual Testing
The website was continuously tested on emulated large and small screens when writing the code. 
Manual testing was used to test navigation, responsiveness on different screen sizes, database operations 
(Create, Read, Update and Delete) and application functions.

### Client Stories Testing
All client stories developed in the beginning of the project were tested. Only two of them were not fulfilled:
* As a shopper I want easily see the total of my purchases at any time - the total quantity was replaced with items count
in the shopping bag. Its is always seen beside the bag icon in the navbar.
* As a registered user I want to be able to delete my account - this was left for future development.

### Deploying To Heroku & AWS
Static files for this project are hosted on AWS, however postgres database and app functionality are provided by Heroku. This section will walk through the complete deployment sequence for both Heroku & AWS.

To deploy this application on Heroku, we are required to have a requirements.txt file as well as a Procfile. These files will allow Heroku understand what dependencies are required, as well as tell Heroku which file to run, in order to launch the web application.

* Create a procfile: in terminal type "echo web: python run.py > Procfile". You will create a file with "web: python app.py" inside.
* Create a requirements file: type "pip freeze --local > requirements.txt". This file will hold a list of all dependencies required for this project.
* Save and commit changes to GitHub.
* Open Heroku and login or sign up.
* Create a new app and select the desired region.
* Connect Github to Heroku via the dashboard link "Deploy". Go to "Deployment method" and choose "GitHub", find your repository name listed and select it.
* Once connected to GitHub repository, navigate to the "Settings" tab and reveal "Config Vars".
* Create environment variables with your data (ensure names match those in settings.py):
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
DATABASE_URL
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
EMAIL_HOST_USER
SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_WH_SECRET
USE_AWS 
* Now enable "Automatic deploys" and wait till build is complete.
* Click "View" to lunch the app. It won't look nice as static files are stored in AWS.

### For Deployment To AWS (S3 Bucket):
* Log in or sign up to [Amazon AWS](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/) console.
* Under the "AWS services" search box, type "S3" and click the associated service.
* Click "Create Bucket" button, provide a name, and the closest region.
* Uncheck the "Block all public access" checkbox & acknowledge the bucket will be public.
* Click "create bucket" at the end of the form.
* Go to the bucket and click the "Properties" tab; select "static website hosting".
* In the box that pops up, click "Use this bucket to host a website".
* Type "index.html" and "error.html" for the index document & error document fields and save.
* Click on the "Permissions" tab and click on "CORS configuration".
* Paste in the following code into the area provided:
``` 
[ { "AllowedHeaders": [ "Authorization" ], 
    "AllowedMethods": [ "GET" ], 
    "AllowedOrigins": [ "*" ], 
    "ExposeHeaders": [] } 
] 
```
* Click on Bucket policy, copy the "ARN" identifier, then select "Policy Generator".
* Use the following settings for the form:
Policy Type: S3 Bucket Policy,
Add Statements: Effect: "allow", 
Principal: "*", 
Actions: "GetObject" 
ARN: Paste your ARN

* Click "Add Statement", then "Generate Policy".
* Copy the generated policy and paste it back into the bucket policy editor.
* Add "/*" to the end of the "Resource" part of the code and click save.
* Click on the Access Control List under the "Permissions" tab.
* Under the "Everyone (public access)" click the "List Objects", aknowledge that you confirm it & "Save".

Your AWS S3 is now configured. To grant specific access, now follow these steps to allow controlled access via the IAM service on AWS.

* Click on the "Services" tab on the top left of the page and search for "IAM".
* Navigate to the IAM dashboard and under the "Access Management" tab, select "Groups".
* Create a new group by providing a name, then click "next" without any further configuration & "Create Group".
* Click "Policies" under the "Access Management" tab anf then click "Create Policy".
* Open the JSON tab and click "Import Managed Policy".
* Select the "AmazonS3FullAccess" option and click "Import".
Now to only allow specific access to the project bucket. In a new tab go back to the S3 bucket and copy the "ARN" again from the bucket policy page.
Now in the JSON Policy for the IAM group, next to resources remove the "/*" and add the following:
```
"Resource": [ 
   "arn: YOUR ARN CODE",
   "arn: YOUR ARN CODE/*",
]
```
* Click "Review Policy"
* Provide a name and description and click "Create Policy"
* Click on "Groups" under the Access Management section.
* Select the group you have created for this project.
* Under Permissions, click "Attach Policy", select the one that has just been created and click "Attach Policy".

#### Now add a user to the group

* Click the "Users" from under the Access Management section and select "Add User".
* Provide a user name, and select "Programmatic access".
* Click next for permissions.
* Select the group for the project using the checkbox provided.
* Click all the way through to the end without changing any further details.
* At the end of the form you will be given user credentials - download CSV file with user access keys.
* To finalize the setup, add your access keys to the environment variables in the Heroku Config Variables. This will allow your Django application to use these settings on the deployed project.
