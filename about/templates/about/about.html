                <p>BabaGifts is a family run business based in Dublin, Ireland. It was founded back in 2014 when
                    our beautiful daughter Leila was born. We wanted to dress her in pretty clothes and matching
                    accessories to show her off to the world. We also cared about the quality of the things we put
                    on her and preferred less items that would last for longer instead of mass shopping of poor quality
                    items.<br>
                    The shoes and hairbands that were available for babies fell short of both fabric quality and design,
                    and we were
                    left searching the internet.

                    We handcraft shoes, hair bows, crowns and more from the softest leather. All our items are made to
                    order to best match
                    our clients' needs. Please feel free to send us an email with any special requirements or questions
                    you may have.
